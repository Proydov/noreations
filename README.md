# No Reations
I refuse to react to messages. It's time to admit that reactions in private messages are meaningless. We think it's important, we think someone will appreciate it. We are wrong.

To be honest, there is a status of a message being read everywhere and that's enough. I read it and it shows. Don't think that I treat you badly if I didn't react. I just want to make my life better and not see unnecessary noise.

👍/🤝/❤️ and others must disappear. The new era is understanding without words and signs.
